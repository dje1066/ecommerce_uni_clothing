Welcome to BMF Clothing! BMF stands for Be My Fashion-- all items are super trendy and belong in your closet. 

Requires latest version of Django, or 3 and above.


Once the server runs, you will start on the front page. You will see basic clothing items listed in two categories: Recommended for you, and Browse.
By clicking a product, you will see the product view with title, image, price, and description. You may add the product to your cart by clicking 
'Add to cart'. It has been added successfully if you have been redirected to the cart view.
    To view your cart, click on 'Cart' in the top right hand corner. This is only available if you log in.

If you have an existing account, log in using /login/. To create an account, head to /signup/. Enter your username and password 
according to the rules (and remember them). Once you are signed in, you will have a My Account option on the navigation header. 
This will lead you to your account info where you will be able to log out. Logging out will lead you back to the front page. 

You may leave reviews with an image through the product view. Only logged-in users are able to use the form feature. 
Non-users can continue looking from the sidelines.

You may also visit the About page by clicking the 'About' in the top right corner, and return to the main page by clicking the 'BMF' logo.
