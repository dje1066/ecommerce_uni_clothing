Welcome to BMF Clothing! BMF stands for Be My Fashion-- all items are super trendy and belong in your closet. 

Please install packages in requirements.txt

Frontend:
Please check folder named 'uni-clothing-frontend' for frontend shenanigans, opened in WebStorm.

If you open the Developer Tools, the fetch operation for my product-view is successful, however, we are only left with 
a blank page. As soon as I get the product details to appear (title, description, price, image), I will be unstoppable.

I have implemented frontend elements into my backend, so the purpose of the frontend folder is to show understanding
of frontend-backend communication between React and Django.


---------


Backend:

Please check folder named 'clothingcode' for backend shenanigans, opened in PyCharm.

Once the server runs, you will start on the front page. You will see basic clothing items listed in two categories: 
Recommended for you, and Browse.

By clicking a product, you will see the product view with title, image, price, and description. You may add the product 
to your cart by clicking 'Add to cart'. It has been added successfully if you have been redirected to the cart view.
    To view your cart, click on 'Cart' in the top right hand corner. This is only available if you log in. Beware, your
    cart only lasts for a day's time.
    Please note that the images are not accurate representations of the product.

To create an account, head to Sign Up in the navigation ribbon. Enter your username and password 
according to the rules (and remember them). 
    If you have an existing account, log in through the button on the sign-up page. 
Once you are signed in, you will have a My Account option on the navigation header. This will lead you to your account 
info where you will be able to log out. Logging out will lead you back to the front page. 

You may leave reviews with an image through the product view. Only logged-in users are able to use the form feature. 
Non-users can continue looking from the sidelines.

You may also visit the About page by clicking the 'About' in the top right corner, and return to the main page by 
clicking the 'BMF' logo.

- my website is only run by one vendor.

Also trying to implement Ratings from Destiny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgEVC7oJDHI 

Also trying to figure out how to display review images: https://codinggear.blog/how-to-upload-images-in-django/ ... 
still attempting to implement.

Thanks to Tailwind CSS for making things look a little more put together: https://tailwindcss.com/
