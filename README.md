Welcome to BMF Clothing! BMF stands for Be My Fashion-- all items are super trendy and belong in your closet. 

Requires latest version of Django, or 3 and above.

Once the server runs, you will start on the front page. You will see basic clothing items listed, which you can click on. 
On the product view, you will see the product title, price, and description. You may add the product to your cart by clicking 
'Add to cart'. It has been added successfully if you have been redirected to the cart view.
    To view your cart, click on 'Cart' in the top right hand corner. This is only available if you log in.

You may leave reviews with an image through the product view. Only logged in users are able to use the form feature. 
Non-users can continue looking from the sidelines.

You may also visit the About page by clicking the 'About' in the top right corner, and return to the main page by clicking the 'BMF' logo.

To create an account, head to /signup/. Enter your username and password according to the rules (and remember them). 
Once you are signed in, you will have a My Account option on the navigation header. This will lead you to your account 
info where you will be able to log out. Logging out will lead you back to the front page. 
    If you have an existing account, log in using /login/



I heavily referenced Code With Stein on YouTube to create this website. Check his tutorial here: https://youtu.be/-QFZsX0b9Cg?si=b65MbWc77TV0kKAz - my website is only run by one vendor.
